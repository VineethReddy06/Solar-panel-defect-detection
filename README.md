Problem Statement
The world is transitioning toward renewable energy to combat climate change and ensure sustainable development. Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable sources; however, maintaining solar panels for maximum efficiency is a challenge. Over time, solar panels can develop defects such as cracks, dust accumulation, delamination, and hotspots that reduce energy output and increase maintenance costs. Manual inspection of solar panels is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to human error.To address this issue, there is a need for an intelligent, automated system that can accurately detect and classify defects in solar panels using advanced technologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Learning. Such a system can promote sustainable energy management, reduce operational inefficiencies, and support the large-scale deployment of renewable energy solutions.Dataset Name:Solar Panel Images Clean and Faulty Images.The Solar Panel Images Dataset is designed to help develop machine learning and deep learning models for detecting defects in solar panels. It contains a collection of real-world solar panel images categorized into clean and faulty panels. This dataset enables automated visual inspection systems to identify and classify various faults that reduce solar panel efficiency..Collect & Prepare Dataset download and preprocess the dataset (resize, normalize images).Train the CNN Model by using TensorFlow/Keras or Teachable Machine to build and train the model.Evaluate & Test the Model by Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.Build the Web Interface by creating a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload solar panel images for defect detection.Test the Complete Application but validating with unseen images and real-world test samples.Deploy the application locally or on the cloud.
