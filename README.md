Problem Statement
The world is transitioning toward renewable energy to combat climate change and ensure sustainable development. Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable sources; however, maintaining solar panels for maximum efficiency is a challenge. Over time, solar panels can develop defects such as cracks, dust accumulation, delamination, and hotspots that reduce energy output and increase maintenance costs. Manual inspection of solar panels is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to human error.To address this issue, there is a need for an intelligent, automated system that can accurately detect and classify defects in solar panels using advanced technologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Learning. Such a system can promote sustainable energy management, reduce operational inefficiencies, and support the large-scale deployment of renewable energy solutions.Dataset Name:Solar Panel Images Clean and Faulty Images.The accumulation of dust, snow, bird drops etc. on the surface of solar panels reduces the efficiency of the solar modules and hence the amount of produced energy. Monitoring and cleaning solar panels is a crucial task, hence developing an optimal procedure to monitor and clean these panels is very important in order to increase modules efficiency, reduce maintenance cost and reducing the use of resources.The objective of this dataset is to investigate the ability of different machine learning classifiers to detect dust, snow, bird drops, physical and electrical on solar panel surfaces with the highest possible accuracy.Collect & Prepare Dataset download and preprocess the dataset (resize, normalize images).Train the CNN Model by using TensorFlow/Keras or Teachable Machine to build and train the model.Evaluate & Test the Model by Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.Build the Web Interface by creating a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload solar panel images for defect detection.Test the Complete Application but validating with unseen images and real-world test samples.Deploy the application locally or on the cloud.
